Today, people are drawn to crystals for a number of reasons, including primarily that they are very beautiful objects and their different shapes, sizes and colours have proved fascinating and mysterious as well.  They can be found in various forms of beautiful jewellery, or on their own in rough uncut specimens that are sometimes used as ornaments to decorate homes. Crystals are used to enhance the body&#39;s own healing abilities, reduce stress and improve the quality of your life. They hold a massive amount of energy and those who work with them believe that they have their own individual energy field or personality. Holding crystals or placing them on your body is thought to promote physical, emotional and spiritual healing. Crystals supposedly do this by positively interacting with your body, energy field, or chakra. While some crystals are said to alleviate stress, others purportedly improve concentration or creativity.
